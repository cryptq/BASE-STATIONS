<DataEntry>The natural 8191 chips of the XA sequence is shortened to 8190 chips to cause&#x000D;&#x000A;precession of the second XA sequence with respect to the natural 8191 chip XB &#x000D;&#x000A;sequence, as shown in Figure 3-6. Re-initialization of the XA shift register &#x000D;&#x000A;produces a 10230-chip sequence by omitting the last 6151 chips of the second &#x000D;&#x000A;natural XA sequence, or reinitializing to all 1s at the 1 ms epoch. The XB shift &#x000D;&#x000A;register is simply allowed to run its natural course until the next 1 ms epoch &#x000D;&#x000A;when it is reinitialized at its initial state, B0, based upon PRN number and phase. &#x000D;&#x000A;This results in the phase of the XB sequence leading by one chip during the &#x000D;&#x000A;second XA sequence in the 1-millisecond period. Depending upon the initial &#x000D;&#x000A;state of the XB sequence, a third 8191-chip sequence may be started &#x000D;&#x000A;before the 10230-chip sequence is completed.</DataEntry>

<DataEntry>The natural 8191 chips of the XA sequence is shortened to 8190 chips to cause&#x000D;&#x000A;precession of the second XA sequence with respect to the natural 8191 chip XB &#x000D;&#x000A;sequence, as shown in Figure 3-6. Re-initialization of the XA shift register &#x000D;&#x000A;produces a 10230-chip sequence by omitting the last 6151 chips of the second &#x000D;&#x000A;natural XA sequence, or reinitializing to all 1s at the 1 ms epoch. The XB shift &#x000D;&#x000A;register is simply allowed to run its natural course until the next 1 ms epoch &#x000D;&#x000A;when it is reinitialized at its initial state, B0, based upon PRN number and phase. &#x000D;&#x000A;This results in the phase of the XB sequence leading by one chip during the &#x000D;&#x000A;second XA sequence in the 1-millisecond period. Depending upon the initial &#x000D;&#x000A;state of the XB sequence, a third 8191-chip sequence may be started &#x000D;&#x000A;before the 10230-chip sequence is completed.</DataEntry>

<DataEntry>The L5 CNAV bit train, D5(t), is rate 1/2 convolution encoded and,&#x000D;&#x000A;thus, clocked at 100 symbols per second (sps). In addition, the &#x000D;&#x000A;100 sps symbols are modulated with a 10-bit Neuman-Hofman code&#x000D;&#x000A;that is clocked at 1 kHz. The resultant symbol sequence is then&#x000D;&#x000A;modulo-2 added with I5 PRN code and used to modulate the L5&#x000D;&#x000A; in-phase carrier.</DataEntry>

Re-initialization of the XA shift register produces a 10230-chip sequence by omitting the last 6151 chips of the second natural XA sequence, or reinitializing to all 1s at the 1 ms epoch. The XB shift &lt;BR&gt;register is simply allowed to run its natural course until the next 1 ms epoch when it is reinitialized at its initial state, B0, based upon PRN number and phase. &lt;BR&gt;This results in the phase of the XB sequence leading by one chip during the second XA sequence in the 1-millisecond period. Depending upon the initial state of the XB sequence, a third 8191-chip sequence may be started before the 10230-chip sequence is completed.&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;Each I5i(t) pattern (I5-code) and Q5i(t) pattern (Q5-code) are the modulo-2 sum of two extended patterns clocked at 10.23 Mbps (XA and XBIi or XBQi). XA is an 8190 length code, with an initial condition of all 1s, that is short cycled 1-chip before its natural conclusion and restarted to run over a period of 1millisecond (synchronized with the L1 frequency C/A-code) for a total of 10,230 chips. The XBIi and XBQi, with initial conditions indicated in Table 3-I, are 8191 length codes that are not short cycled. They are restarted at their natural completion and run over a period of 1 millisecond (synchronized with the XA code) for a total of 10,230 chips.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;FONT face=TimesNewRoman size=2&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. &quot;GPS L5 RF TX&quot;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;This design&amp;nbsp;generate fully coded L5 source by using L5 XA&amp;nbsp;code, L5 XIi code and XQi codewith an RF transmission design.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The L5 signal is contained within a 24 MHz band centered about the L5 nominal frequency. The carrier frequencies for the L1, L2 and L5 signals shall be coherently derived from a common frequency source within the SV. The nominal frequency of this source -- as it appears to an observer on the ground -- is 10.23 MHz. The SV carrier frequency and clock rates -- as they would appear to an observer located in the SV -- are offset to compensate for relativistic effects. The clock rates are offset by &#x0394; f/f = -4.4647E-10, equivalent to a change in the I5 and Q5-code chipping rate of 10.23 MHz offset by a &#x0394; f = -4.5674E-3 Hz. This is equal to 10.22999999543 MHz. The nominal carrier frequency (f0) -- as it appears to an observer on the ground &#x2013;shall be 1176.45 MHz, or 115 times 10.23 MHz.&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;The two L5 carrier components modulated by the two separate bit trains (I5-code plus data and Q5-code with no data) shall be in phase quadrature (within &#x00B1;100 milliradians) with the Q5 signal carrier lagging the I5 signal by 90 degrees. Referring to the phase of the I5 carrier when I5i(t) equals zero as the &quot;zero phase angle&quot;, the I5 and Q5-code generator output shall control the respective signal phases in the following manner: when I5i(t) equals one, a 180-degree phase reversal of the I5-carrier occurs; when Q5i(t) equals one, the Q5 carrier advances 90 degrees; when the Q5i(t) equals zero, the Q5 carrier shall be retarded 90 degrees (such that when Q5i(t) changes state, a 180-degree phase reversal of the Q5 carrier occurs). The resultant nominal composite transmitted signal phases as a function of the binary state of the modulating signals are as shown in Table 3-II.&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;Nominal Composite&amp;nbsp; L5 Signal Phase&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I5&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Q5&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0&#x00B0;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-90&#x00B0;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;+90&#x00B0;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 180&#x00B0;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/P&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT face=TimesNewRoman&gt;&lt;FONT face=TimesNewRoman&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#x000D;&#x000A;&lt;P align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</Text>
