AMP_Xparams.mdl:

	This x-parameters file is extracted from an AMP designed in Keysight ADS.  The extraction is performed under the following conditions:
	(1) 2 fundamental frequencies (2 tones): 1GHz and 1.2GHz
	(2) Power sweep at each frequency from -30 dBm to 10 dBm at 10 dB step
	(3) DC bias is at 10 Volts
	(4) The maximum order (harmonic number) of the fundamental(s) that will be considered is 5
	(5) The maximum mixing order is 3
